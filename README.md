# Super Awesome Movie App

This is the submission for the mobile project, which is an app that ets you search for, and favourite movies and tv shows and chat about them with other users.
The code is divided into files with pretty straight forward naming, the only one that might be a bit confusing is that the login is named mainActivity(but isn't really the main activity) this happend beacuse we planned to start the app from there, but had to make it start somewhere else instead.
We have some buggs here and there that we didn't have time/ability to fixs and the two we have found at the time i write this is that the favoriting ends up favoriting something else further down the list to, we think the error is graphical, but have not been able to find the cause.
The other bugg is that the "display cinema movies" and the "search" button both needs to be pressed twice to show its content, at the time writing this we are trying to fixs the bug, but unsure if it will be fixed to deadline.

## Getting Started

open the project in android studio and compile on your device, you can register a new user from the app, and the log in from there

## Built With

* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - Database for messages, user info and favoruites
* [volley](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/) - Request library
* [circleimageview](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) - Circulize images
*  [bumbtech glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) - Circulize images

## Report!

We started of planning most of the layout of the app and drawing the activitis on papir so that we all knew what everything was supposed to look like. 
After that we decided to work seperatly, and only have groupmeetings once in a while. After seeing that none of us was to good with time managment we later ended up working together at school all of us.
The app in itsealf is manly for showing movies on cinema now, and also for searching the moviedb for movies and tvseries. When findig one you are interested in you can click on it and chat about it with others. 
There are still many things we would like to implement in this app, but seeing as we are a bit bad at managing our time, and also that we had other schoolprojects to work on, we didn't have time to implement. 
Some of this features are:
-More details about each movie
-The possibility to search for single episodes, and not only the whole show
-Notification system, both for updated chat in your favourit movie/shows, but also if a tv-show gets a new episode.
-Better/more design.

I dont think any of ous found anything about the assignment "easy" in any way. There was ofcourse bits of code that took less time than others, but all in all we found it to be both a challenging and fun task. I think we all three have grown as programmers, and also gotten a fresh and better feel for how it is to manage a smal project like this.
We found many challanges under ways in the development process, and while it is cliche, i think the most challanging thing was to manage our time. To first plan out and then to be able to exsecute said tasks on your own whitout anyone checking up on your progress makes you slack of alot more then i first was aware of. Understanding this and trying to make changes to better work against this was something we found challanging in the beginning, but became smother as time went by.
Another thing we in retrospect can say we found challanging was perhaps the coding itsealf. Not in a "i dont know anything about coding" way, but more in a "i'm used to working alone on assigmnets, but now i have to work with others, and their coding standar" way.
We think that setting a universal codingstandard for all three of us to follow would have saved us time in the long run, making everything more readeble, and also making it easier for everyone to work on eachothers code, which wasn't always as easy as we tought it would be.
All in all we feel like this was a enriching experiense, giving us both a wakeupcall and a feeling of accomplishment at the same time. Hacking us down a peg because we tought we were better coders than we perhaps are, but then building up confidense in making us work more on the fundamentals/coding in a team.
